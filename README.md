# eMBB Optimization using X3C Algorithm

This repository contains the implementation of the X3C algorithm for the optimization of eMBB services in 5G networks. The X3C algorithm is a novel optimization algorithm based on the X3C problem, which is a generalization of the well-known 3D matching problem. The X3C algorithm is used to optimize the allocation of resources in 5G networks to maximize the performance of eMBB services. The implementation is done in Python.

`results/` contains the results of simulataions for the X3C algorithm in `x3c.py`. The results are stored in JSON files as array of tuples `(x,y)` which is then used to plot the results using `plot.py`.

`plots/` contains the plots generated from the results of the X3C algorithm.
